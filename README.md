## My process

After building the structure of the component and styling the basic elements, I got to a point where I was having trouble aligning the buttons. But after looking things over, my issue was that I had displayed the buttons as inline-blocks and not just blocks. When I fixed that, the buttons stretched to full.

After that, minor visual adjustments and a media query to fix the padding on mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this, its just mainly repetition. I need to get practice and make it feel second nature.

### Continued development

I'd like to bump the complexity a little bit. But looking forward, I need to work on solidifying this knowledge so that I know it off the top of my head and not needing to reference my notes as much. I'm getting there but it'll still take time.
